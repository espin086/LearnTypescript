## Notes

### Section 1

Typescript was created by Microsoft to address the issues iwth JavaScirpt. Every JS file is a valid TS file, but we have more robust features in TS.

- Static Typing: like C++, C# or Java has explicit declarations for variable type such as ```int number = 10;``` can only take integers. While Python is dynamically typed and provides great flexibility we need to test heavily. 
- Code Completion
- Refactoring
- Shorthand
